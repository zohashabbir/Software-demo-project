#Stack-based String Reversal and Palindrome Check in C++
<br>
<b>
Overview
<br>
This C++ program demonstrates two important operations on strings using a stack data structure:
<br>
String Reversal: Reverses a given string using a custom Stack class.
<br>
Palindrome Check: Determines if a given string is a palindrome by pushing each character onto a stack and comparing the reversed version to the original string.
<br>
The program uses basic stack operations such as push(), pop(), and peek() to achieve these tasks.
<br>
<b>
#Features
<br>
Stack Implementation: The stack is implemented using a dynamic array with standard stack operations like push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
<br>
String Reversal: A string is pushed onto the stack and then popped to reverse the order of characters.
<br>
Palindrome Check: The program checks if a string reads the same forward and backward using the stack.
<br>

Code Explanation
<br>
Stack Class
<br>
push(char c): Adds a character to the stack.
<br>
pop(): Removes and returns the top character from the stack.
<br>
isEmpty(): Returns whether the stack is empty.
<br>
peek(): Returns the top element without removing it from the stack.
<br>
<b>
Main Functions
<br>
reverseString(char str[], int n): Reverses the string using the stack.
<br>
isPalindrome(const string& str): Checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
<br>
<b>
Requirements
<br>
A C++ compiler like g++.
<br>
Basic knowledge of stack data structures.
<br>
<b>
Future Enhancements
<br>
Add support for different types of data in the stack.
<br>
Optimize palindrome check for case-insensitive comparisons.
<br>
Implement additional string manipulation features using stacks.
